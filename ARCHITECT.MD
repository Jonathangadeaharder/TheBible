# Architecture Decision Principles

This document outlines the principles for making and documenting architecture decisions in software projects.

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

All significant architecture decisions must be recorded as Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to ensure transparency, traceability, and knowledge sharing.

### ADR Format

Each ADR should follow this structure:

1. **Title**: Brief, descriptive title of the decision
2. **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
3. **Context**: Problem statement and driving forces
4. **Decision**: Chosen approach and rationale
5. **Consequences**: Positive and negative outcomes
6. **Alternatives**: Considered options and why they were rejected

### When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR for decisions that:
- Affect the system's structure or behavior
- Have significant cost or risk implications
- Are difficult to change later
- Impact multiple teams or components
- Involve technology selection
- Address cross-cutting concerns (security, performance, scalability)

## Design Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- Divide system into distinct features with minimal overlap
- Each module should have a single responsibility
- Clear boundaries between components

### 2. Modularity
- Design components that can be developed, tested, and deployed independently
- Minimize dependencies between modules
- Use well-defined interfaces

### 3. Scalability
- Design for horizontal scaling when possible
- Consider performance implications of design choices
- Plan for growth in users, data, and traffic

### 4. Maintainability
- Favor simplicity over cleverness
- Write code that is easy to understand and modify
- Document complex decisions and trade-offs

### 5. Security
- Apply security principles by design
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Consider threat modeling for critical components

## Documentation Standards

### C4 Model
Use the C4 model for architecture visualization:
- **Context**: System landscape and external dependencies
- **Containers**: High-level technical decomposition
- **Components**: Detailed decomposition of containers
- **Code**: Implementation details (UML diagrams, code snippets)

### Diagram Guidelines
- Keep diagrams simple and focused
- Use consistent notation and style
- Include legends for custom symbols
- Maintain diagrams alongside code
- Reference diagrams in ADRs when relevant
