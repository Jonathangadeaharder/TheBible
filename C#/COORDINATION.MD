# C# Development - Human-Centered Workflow

## Key Principle

Focus on effective team collaboration rather than complex agent coordination.

## Simple Workflow Approach

### 1. Task Identification
- Clearly define what needs to be built
- Break down complex features into smaller tasks
- Estimate effort and complexity

### 2. Skill Matching
- Match tasks to team members based on expertise
- Consider learning goals and career development
- Balance workload across the team

### 3. Implementation
- Follow established coding standards
- Use pair programming for complex tasks
- Conduct regular check-ins on progress

### 4. Review & Feedback
- Perform code reviews with constructive feedback
- Test functionality thoroughly
- Ensure code meets acceptance criteria

## Communication Guidelines

### Daily Standups
- What did you work on yesterday?
- What are you working on today?
- Any blockers or impediments?

### Task Handoffs
- Document key decisions and context
- Ensure clear understanding of requirements
- Provide access to relevant resources

### Problem Resolution
- Address issues early before they become blockers
- Involve the right people to solve problems
- Document solutions for future reference

## Tools & Practices

### Recommended Tools
- **Project Management**: Jira, Trello, or Azure DevOps
- **Version Control**: Git with feature branches
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, or Jenkins
- **Communication**: Slack, Teams, or email

### Best Practices
- Keep documentation close to the code
- Write automated tests for critical functionality
- Maintain a clean, readable codebase
- Regular retrospectives to improve processes

## When to Add Complexity

Only consider more complex coordination systems when:
- Team grows beyond 8-10 developers
- Multiple distributed teams are involved
- Regulatory compliance requires detailed tracking
- Current simple approach is proven inadequate

For most teams, this human-centered approach will be more effective than complex agent orchestration.
