## Universal Workflow Approach

- Break down complex problems into manageable pieces

### 2. Solution Design
- Explore multiple approaches
- Consider trade-offs between simplicity and functionality
- Document key decisions and rationale

### 3. Implementation
- Follow established coding standards
- Use version control with meaningful commits
- Conduct regular check-ins and progress updates

### 4. Review & Improvement
- Perform peer reviews with constructive feedback
- Test functionality against requirements
- Gather feedback and iterate as needed

## Cross-Language Communication Guidelines

### Team Meetings
- Daily standups: Yesterday, Today, Blockers
- Weekly retrospectives: What went well, What didn't, Improvements
- Planning sessions: Prioritize work and estimate effort

### Knowledge Sharing
- Keep documentation close to the code
- Use README files for project-level information
- Create simple examples to illustrate concepts

### Decision Making
- Involve the right people in decisions
- Document architectural choices
- Revisit decisions when circumstances change

## General Tools & Practices

### Recommended Tools
- **Project Management**: Jira, Trello, Asana, or GitHub Projects
- **Version Control**: Git with feature branches and pull requests
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or similar platforms
- **Communication**: Slack, Teams, Discord, or email

### Best Practices
- Write code that's easy to read and maintain
- Automate testing and deployment when possible
- Keep processes lightweight and adaptable
- Focus on delivering value to users
- Regular retrospectives to improve team effectiveness

## When to Consider Complex Systems

Only add complexity when:
- Team size exceeds what can be effectively managed with simple processes
- Distributed teams require formal coordination
- Regulatory or compliance requirements demand detailed tracking
- Simple approaches have proven inadequate for specific needs

## Language-Specific Guidance

For detailed guidance on specific languages and frameworks, see:
- [C# Development](./C#/README.md)
- [C++ Development](./C++/README.md)
- [React Development](./React/README.md)
- [Python Development](./Python/README.md)

The goal is to provide enough guidance for effective development while avoiding the bureaucratic overhead that can hinder productivity.
