# C++ Development Guidelines

## Overview

Essential guidelines and patterns for modern C++ development.

## Contents

- **PATTERNS.MD**: Essential design patterns with RAII focus
- **IPC.MD**: Inter-process communication methods for C++ applications
- **Other guides**: Clean code, testing, static analysis, and concurrency

## Getting Started

1. Master RAII and smart pointers for resource management
2. Understand modern C++ features (auto, move semantics, etc.)
3. Learn appropriate IPC mechanisms for your use case

## Key Principles

- Prefer stack allocation over heap allocation
- Use smart pointers instead of raw pointers
- Follow the Rule of Five for resource management
- Apply const correctness consistently
- Leverage modern C++ features for safer, cleaner code
