# Development Guidelines Bible

## Overview

A collection of essential guidelines, patterns, and best practices for software development across multiple languages and technologies.

## Structure

### Root Directory - Guideline Files (The "Constitution")
General principles and standards applicable to all languages:
- **ARCHITECT.MD**: Architecture decision principles and standards
- **CLEANCODE.MD**: Universal clean code principles
- **COMMIT.MD**: Commit message standards
- **TESTING.MD**: Testing principles and standards
- And more...

### Commands Directory - Coordination Files (The "Management System")
Human-centered coordination workflows:
- **commands/ARCHITECT.MD**: Workflow for architectural decision-making
- **commands/CLEANCODE.MD**: Workflow for code review and quality assurance
- **commands/COMMIT.MD**: Workflow for commit message standards
- **commands/TESTING.MD**: Workflow for testing standards compliance

### Prompts Directory - Agent Personas (The "Expert Team")
Specialized AI agent personas for each technology:
- **prompts/C#/**: Expert C# agents (ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, Testing)
- **prompts/C++/**: Expert C++ agents (Modern C++, Testing)
- **prompts/React/**: Expert React agents (Components, Testing)
- **prompts/Python/**: Expert Python agents (Clean Code, Testing, Data Science)

### Language-Specific Directories
Technology-specific guidelines and practices:
- [C#](./C#/README.md): C# development guidelines
- [C++](./C++/README.md): C++ development guidelines
- [React](./React/README.md): React development guidelines
- [Python](./Python/README.md): Python development guidelines

## Philosophy

This repository follows a clear separation between principles, coordination, and execution:

1. **Guideline Files** (Root): Define the "constitution" - the standards, principles, and rationale
2. **Coordination Files** (commands/): Define the "management system" - human-centered workflows for team collaboration
3. **Persona Files** (prompts/): Define the "expert team" - specialized agent personas with specific skills and knowledge

## Getting Started

1. Consult the guideline files to understand the principles and standards
2. Review the coordination workflow files to understand team processes
3. Explore the persona files to understand specialized agent capabilities
4. Browse language directories for technology-specific guidance
5. Follow the README.md in each directory for detailed overviews

## Contributing

- Keep guideline files focused on essential principles and rationale
- Ensure coordination workflows promote effective team collaboration
- Develop persona files with clear roles, responsibilities, and constraints
- Maintain clear traceability between guidelines, coordination, and personas
- Follow the principle-based approach with human-centered workflows
