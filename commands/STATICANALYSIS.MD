# Static Analysis Tools Guide

This document provides an overview of the best static analysis tools that can be used via MCP or CLI for various programming languages. Each programming language subdirectory contains specific tool recommendations and usage examples.

## Purpose

Static analysis tools help identify potential bugs, security vulnerabilities, code smells, and maintainability issues before code execution. They are essential for maintaining code quality and preventing defects early in the development cycle.

## Language-Specific Guides

For detailed information about static analysis tools for specific programming languages, please refer to the language-specific guides:

- [C# Static Analysis Tools](./C#/STATICANALYSIS.MD)
- [C++ Static Analysis Tools](./C++/STATICANALYSIS.MD)
- [Python Static Analysis Tools](./Python/STATICANALYSIS.MD)
- [React/JavaScript Static Analysis Tools](./React/STATICANALYSIS.MD)

## General Best Practices

1. **Integrate Early**: Incorporate static analysis into your development workflow as early as possible
2. **Automate**: Run static analysis tools in CI/CD pipelines to catch issues before merging
3. **Configure Rules**: Customize rule sets to match your team's coding standards
4. **Baseline Existing Issues**: When introducing tools to existing codebases, create baselines to focus on new issues
5. **Regular Updates**: Keep tools updated to benefit from the latest security checks and improvements
6. **Combine Tools**: Use multiple complementary tools for comprehensive coverage
7. **Fail Fast**: Configure builds to fail on critical issues detected by static analysis

## Common Categories of Static Analysis

1. **Syntax and Style Checking**: Enforce coding standards and style guides
2. **Bug Detection**: Identify potential runtime errors and logical flaws
3. **Security Analysis**: Detect security vulnerabilities and unsafe practices
4. **Performance Analysis**: Find potential performance bottlenecks
5. **Maintainability Analysis**: Identify code smells and complexity issues
6. **Dependency Analysis**: Check for vulnerable or outdated dependencies

## Integration Methods

1. **CLI Tools**: Direct command-line execution for local development and CI/CD
2. **MCP Integration**: Model Context Protocol integration for AI-assisted analysis
3. **IDE Plugins**: Real-time feedback during development
4. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automated checks before code commits
5. **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**: Automated checks during build processes

## Evaluation Criteria

When selecting static analysis tools, consider:

1. **Accuracy**: Low false positive and false negative rates
2. **Performance**: Fast execution times for large codebases
3. **Customizability**: Ability to configure rules and thresholds
4. **Integration Support**: Compatibility with your development environment
5. **Community and Support**: Active maintenance and community backing
6. **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples
7. **Reporting**: Clear and actionable issue reporting
8. **Scalability**: Ability to handle projects of varying sizes
