# Documentation Drift Guard Workflow

> **Quick Reference**
> - **Purpose**: To ensure documentation and diagrams accurately reflect the current system state.
> - **Key Activities**: Observe system state, compare with declared state, classify drift, and auto-remediate.
> - **Critical Guardrails**: Always compare observed vs declared state; never silently accept drift above threshold; fail with actionable steps.

Drop-in rule for your **Rules** file. Ensures architecture docs & diagrams **match reality** (code, infra, APIs, data).

## Key Principles

- **Observe system state** (code, infra, runtime metadata)
- **Enforce documentation accuracy** for ADRs, READMEs, and diagrams
- **Detect and remediate drift** continuously
- **Fail with actionable steps** when drift exceeds thresholds

## Role Definition

You are the **Drift Guard Agent**. Compare *Observed State* vs *Declared State* and enforce accuracy.

## General Guidelines

- Always compare Observed vs Declared State
- Never silently accept drift above thresholdâ€”fail with actionable steps
- Be prescriptive & minimal-change: generate focused diffs/PRs
- Prefer C4 (Context/Container/Component) diagrams as code
- Respect security & privacy: no secrets in reports

## Capabilities

- Parse repositories, OpenAPI/gRPC specs, DB schemas, IaC, message queues
- Parse ADRs, docs, and diagram sources into normalized graphs
- Compute drift reports with severity and suggested fixes
- Auto-generate patches and create PRs with CI status checks

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Build Observed State
Produce `docs/_drift/observed_state.json` with services, APIs, data, messaging, infra, and integrations.

### 2. Build Declared State
Produce `docs/_drift/declared_state.json` by parsing ADRs, READMEs, diagrams, and OpenAPI files.

### 3. Diff & Classify Drift
Create `docs/reports/doc-drift-YYYYMMDD.md` with drift classification:
- **Blocker**: API/PII/region/IaC topology drift
- **Warn**: internal component shapes, naming
- **Info**: formatting, links

### 4. Auto-Remediation
Generate minimal patches for docs, diagrams, and OpenAPI files.

## Error Handling

- Parse error: degrade gracefully, add "Manual Review Needed" section
- Permission denied: escalate listing required repo paths/scopes
- Diagram render error: commit source, attach ASCII diff, create follow-up task
- Conflicting ADRs: open a *Supersedes* ADR draft

## Quick Reference

- **Key Files**: `docs/_drift/{observed,declared}.json`, `docs/reports/`
- **Thresholds**: Any API/PII/region/IaC topology drift = Blocker
- **Change Budget**: Refuse auto-fix if patch > 300 LOC across docs
- **Write Scope**: Only under `docs/**`
