# Parallel Programming Guidelines

Parallel programming enables concurrent execution to improve performance but introduces complexity. Follow these principles for safe and effective parallel code.

## Core Principles

1. **Avoid shared mutable state** - Minimize data sharing between threads/tasks
2. **Use immutable data structures** when possible
3. **Prefer higher-level abstractions** over low-level primitives
4. **Design for thread safety** from the start
5. **Measure performance gains** - Parallelism adds overhead

## Common Patterns

### Task Parallelism
- Divide work into independent tasks
- Use thread pools to manage resources
- Avoid blocking operations in parallel tasks

### Data Parallelism
- Apply same operation to different data elements
- Use partitioning strategies for balanced workload
- Minimize synchronization between parallel operations

### Pipeline Parallelism
- Break work into sequential stages
- Each stage processes data independently
- Pass results between stages efficiently

## Key Challenges

### Race Conditions
- Multiple threads accessing shared data simultaneously
- Results depend on thread scheduling
- Solution: Synchronization mechanisms

### Deadlocks
- Threads waiting for each other indefinitely
- Circular resource dependencies
- Solution: Consistent locking order, timeouts

### Performance Issues
- Thread overhead exceeding benefits
- False sharing in CPU caches
- Solution: Appropriate granularity, profiling

## Best Practices

- Start with sequential implementation
- Profile before and after parallelization
- Use appropriate synchronization primitives
- Handle exceptions in parallel code
- Test thoroughly under load
- Document threading assumptions
