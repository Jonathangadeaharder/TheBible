# React Development - Human-Centered Workflow

## Key Principle

Focus on effective frontend team collaboration rather than complex agent coordination.

## Simple Workflow Approach

### 1. Feature Planning
- Define user stories and acceptance criteria
- Break down features into component-level tasks
- Estimate development effort and testing needs

### 2. Component Design
- Sketch component hierarchy and data flow
- Define component interfaces and props
- Plan state management approach

### 3. Implementation
- Follow React best practices and coding standards
- Use pair programming for complex components
- Conduct regular check-ins on progress

### 4. Review & Testing
- Perform code reviews with constructive feedback
- Test components in isolation and integration
- Ensure responsive design and accessibility

## Communication Guidelines

### Daily Standups
- What did you work on yesterday?
- What are you working on today?
- Any blockers or impediments?

### Component Handoffs
- Document component APIs and usage examples
- Ensure clear understanding of design requirements
- Provide access to design assets and specifications

### Problem Resolution
- Address issues early before they become blockers
- Involve designers and UX experts when needed
- Document solutions for future reference

## Tools & Practices

### Recommended Tools
- **Project Management**: Jira, Trello, or Linear
- **Version Control**: Git with feature branches
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, CircleCI, or Vercel
- **Design Collaboration**: Figma, Zeplin, or Adobe XD
- **Communication**: Slack, Discord, or Teams

### Best Practices
- Keep components small and focused
- Use TypeScript for better code quality
- Write automated tests for critical components
- Maintain a consistent design system
- Regular retrospectives to improve processes

## When to Add Complexity

Only consider more complex coordination systems when:
- Team grows beyond 6-8 frontend developers
- Multiple distributed teams are involved
- Current simple approach is proven inadequate

For most teams, this human-centered approach will be more effective than complex agent orchestration.
